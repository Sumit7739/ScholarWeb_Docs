## Future Enhancements

ScholarWeb is primarily developed for use in the web development classes that i am currently teaching, and its features will evolve based on user needs and feedback.
#### Recent Updates on Users needs :

- **Profile Image Support:** Recent enhancements include the addition of profile image upload functionality.
- **Image Upload in Feed:** An image upload option for the feed section allows students to attach images of their problems instead of only writing out their doubts.

#### Future enhancements may include:

## Accessing the Platform

Currently, ScholarWeb allows only registered users to sign up and log in, with access controlled by the admin. However, there are plans to implement a **Guest Section** that will allow others to view the platform's features and functionality without needing to enroll in any classess. This will provide potential users with a better understanding of what ScholarWeb offers before committing to registration.
